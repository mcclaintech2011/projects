                    <p>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." - <em>Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear</em><br>
                    <p>"The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it." -<em> Morpheus</em>
<br>
                    <p>"I discovered religion watching Luke Skywalker rescue Princess Leah and destroy the Death Star by letting go and closing his eyes." - <em>Guy Forsyth, Long Long Time</em><br>
